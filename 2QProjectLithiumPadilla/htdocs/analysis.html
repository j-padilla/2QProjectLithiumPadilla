        <ul>
          <li>
            Tenya Ida (飯いい田だ天てん哉や), also to be known as Turbo Hero: Ingenium (ターボヒーロー・インゲニウム Tābo Hīrō Ingeniumu?) in the future, is the class representative of Class 1-A at U.A. High School, and is training there to become a Pro Hero.

            <h5><li>Overall Abilities</li></h5>
              <p>
                Tenya has repeatedly shown that he is a highly formidable combatant. His skills earned him fourth place in the Quirk Apprehension Test; sixth place in the U.A. Entrance Exam, having the second-highest amount of villain points; and fourth place at the U.A. Sports Festival, although he qualified for third place if he had stayed for the closing ceremony. Thanks to his Quirk, Tenya has been revered as one of the fastest students in Class 1-A, and he uses his increased speed to supplement his fighting style which involves powerful, high-speed kicks that can even crush metal. Using his incredible speed and quick reflexes, Tenya swiftly defeated Ibara Shiozaki, one of the most formidable students in Class 1-B, and nearly defeated Shoto Todoroki, one of the strongest students in Class 1-A, but the latter blindsided Tenya by freezing his mufflers before encasing Tenya in ice. 
              </p>
              <h5><li>Keen Intellect</li></h5>
              <p>
                Tenya was ranked 2nd place in the mid-terms for Class 1-A, proving his tremendous academic prowess. He was able to discern that there were parameters of the U.A. Entrance Exam that he was unaware of. Tenya also has strategic and tactical abilities. 
                <br>
                <br>
                When he was paired with Mashirao Ojiro to battle Power Loader in the Final Exams, Tenya came up with a strategy that involved carrying Mashirao on his back and using "Recipro Burst" in order to swiftly evade the traps Power Loader had set. When it seemed that the Pro Hero was about to defeat them, Tenya quickly thought of another plan, in which Mashirao wrapped his tail around Tenya’s leg, and Tenya himself used "Recipro Extend" to fling Mashirao to the escape gate, while the latter parried Power Loader's attack, quickly securing victory for the young heroes.
                <br>
                <br>
                Tenya is a strong leader, as shown when he was able to calm his panicked peers during an evacuation that was turning into a stampede. Tenya became class president of Class 1-A after Izuku resigned and gave the position to him, believing him to be better suited for the job.

        <h3>Quirk: Engine</h3>
        <ul class="cont" style="list-style-type:square;">
          <p>
            <li>
              Tenya's Quirk gives him car-like engines in each of his calves, giving him incredible running speed and extreme kicking power. Tenya needs to fuel his engines by drinking orange juice.
              <br>
              <br>
              Tenya's engines have multiple gears; it is currently unknown how many, but it has been implied that there are more than three. Much like a real engine, his Quirk requires that the exhaust pipes on the backs of his legs remain clear of obstructions in order to function properly.
            </li>
            <br>
            <br>
            <li>
              As part of his training, Tenya engaged in hardcore, long-distance running to increase his leg strength and stamina so that he can run faster for longer periods of time. During the Quirk Apprehension Test, he ran fifty meters in 3.04 in third gear, meaning he ran at an average speed of 51.29 kilometers per hour (36.79 miles per hour), making his maximum speed greatly in excess of this.

        <ul>
          <li>
            Mirai Sasaki (佐さ々さ木き未み来らい), also known as Sir Nighteye (サー・ナイトアイ Sā Naitoai?) was a Pro Hero and Mirio Togata's mentor. He was also formerly a sidekick and was considered to be the brains behind All Might.
          </li>
          <li>
            Unusually for a Pro Hero, Nighteye appeared to prefer plain office clothes (a plain white suit with gold buttons, a white dress shirt, and a red tie with white dots) instead of an elaborate hero costume. His clothes, however, seemed to be quite durable, as he used them during battles and they didn't show any sign of damage or tearing.

          <h5><li>Overall Abilities</li></h5>
            <p>
              According to All Might, Sir Nighteye did not have any impressive physical abilities and acted more of a support for his intelligence. However, he was shown to be exceptionally fast and capable of throwing heavy projectiles, particularly his Hyper-Density Seals, as well as being able to trip up very large foes. Furthermore, under his suit, he sported an impressive physique, showing that he either deliberately hid his physical prowess to catch opponents off-guard, had increased his physical prowess after his falling out with All Might, or a combination of the previous two factors.
              <br>
              <br>
              Aside from his Quirk, Nighteye's abilities laid with his own intellect. He acted as the brains for All Might during their partnership. Nighteye used his intelligence, sometimes in tandem with his Foresight, to come up with strategies to tackle situations and make sure the best outcome could be achieved.

        <h3>Quirk: Foresight</h3>
        <ul class="cont" style="list-style-type:square;">
          <p>
            <li>
              Foresight (予よ知ち Yochi?): Mirai's Quirk allowed him to see another person's future from a third person's point of view. In order to activate his power, Mirai had to first touch the intended target, and then, make eye contact with them. This Quirk stayed active for one hour, and once activated, it required 24 hours before it could be activated again.
              <br>
              <br>
While his Quirk was active, Mirai could see as far as years into a person's future. The future he saw was shown in great detail (second by second) and it had always been 100% accurate, even when he tried to change the events he had foresaw.
            </li>
            <br>
            <br>
            <li>
              However, it has been shown that Quirks that alter an object's flow of time in some way can affect the accuracy of Mirai's Quirk, rendering the predicted outcomes moot and/or void.

            Enji Todoroki (轟とどろき炎えん司じ Todoroki Enji?), also known as the Flame Hero: Endeavor (フレイムヒーロー エンデヴァー Fureimu Hīrō Endevā?), is the Pro Hero with the highest tally of resolved cases in history, husband to Rei Todoroki, and father of Toya, Fuyumi, Natsuo, and Shoto Todoroki.

          <h5><li>Overall Abilities</li></h5>
            <p>
              Endeavor was ranked 2nd of Japan's heroes. He is known for having the most solved cases out of any crime fighter, and by the age of 20, Endeavor took his place as the No. 2 Pro Hero. He also possesses a proficient handle on his powerful Quirk, Hellflame, using his flames to overwhelm his opponents with extreme heat, along with other purposes.
              <br>
              <br>
              As he is ranked highly, Endeavor is a very powerful hero, which has been proven in his fight against the League of Villains. He has repeatedly faced and defeated multiple grades of Nomu without sustaining any damage, something for which he is praised by the likes of All For One, an incredibly dangerous and experienced villain. During the Kamino Incident, Endeavor teamed up with Edgeshot to temporarily battle All For One, and emerge unscathed. Endeavor has also displayed the ability to contend with High End Nomu such as Hood and Woman with help from other heroes. In the aforementioned bout with Hood, Endeavor displayed his high speed and power by dicing a large portion of a skyscraper before it could collapse, as well as incinerate most of Hood's body thrice. In the Paranormal Liberation War, Endeavor proved to be integral against the 75% body-enhanced Tomura Shigaraki, inflicting the most amount of damage (alongside Izuku Midoriya) that caused the villain's body to eventually break down, in spite of the Flame Hero being outmatched by Tomura.
            </p>
          <h5><li>Enhanced Strength</li></h5>
            <p>
              After years of physical training, Endeavor obtained incredible physical strength, though it is not at the level of All Might. He was able to knock Gigantomachia backwards with a flame-propelled skull bash.
            </p>
          <h5><li>Enhanced Durability</li></h5>
            <p>
              Endeavor possesses incredible durability as he was able to withstand being thrown through multiple concrete-laced skyscraper walls by Hood, who was using multiple Quirks, and emerge with moderate injuries. When fighting a body-modified Tomura Shigaraki, Endeavor endured several of his augmented blows despite the villain possessing physical strength nearly rivaling that of All Might. Afterwards, Endeavor was able skull-bash the thick-bodied Gigantomachia without suffering significant head trauma, but the pyromancer was knocked unconscious by his own attack.
            </p>
          <h5><li>Enhanced Stamina</li></h5>
            <p>
              Endeavor is far more resistant to pain than the average Pro Hero, as seen when he was able to stand up, despite receiving numerous attacks from Hood, and long after his body should have become unable to move. During the climax of the Paranormal Liberation War, Endeavor‘s movements were stymied by his burnt lungs, caused from overusing his Quirk, but he was still able to remain standing and eventually knock down Gigantomachia, but Endeavor was put out of commission afterwards.
            </p>
          <h5><li>Enhanced Reflexes</li></h5>
            <p>
              Due to training to become the No. 1 hero, Endeavor learned to react exceedingly fast to dangerous situations and people in need. During his battle with Hood he could counter one of his attacks with his "Jet Burn" in spite of his clouded vision. Later, while having a conversation outside with Izuku, Endeavor was able to react to a cry for help before the sound of the cry reached the One For All inheritor.
            </p>
          <h5><li>Keen Intellect</li></h5>
            <p>
              Endeavor has extraordinary intelligence, having used it to tally up the most resolved criminal cases in history. He has very keen deductive skills, shown when he deduced that Izuku's Quirk resembled that of All Might after only seeing it used briefly. During the Hosu Incident, Endeavor identified the nature of Four-Eyed Nomu's Absorption and Release Quirk and took notice that the creature still retained damage from the low-temperature flame attack Endeavor employed, even after the creature redirected it back at the Flame Hero. Throughout his battle against Hood, Endeavor displayed more of his intelligence as he analyzed the situation against the High-End Nomu, while fighting against it.
              <br>
              <br>
              When he witnessed Hood regenerate itself, while recollecting how the lighter-colored Nomus lacked the said ability, Endeavor surmised that the black Nomus have more abilities than the other Nomu breeds. Endeavor later recalled how Hood was seeking a strong opponent, and discerned that the High-End Nomu wasn't interested in weaker opponents, hence the reason the villain spawned lower-level Nomu to hinder the ignikinetic's reinforcements. Seeing Hood remove its own head twice made Endeavor realize that said body part is the central weak point of the villain. In the climax of the strenuous bout, Endeavor took notice of Hood acting more feral and the Super Regeneration keeping up with the internal burns. Intending to avoid collateral damage, Endeavor directed Hawks with an arrow of flame to use his nearly incinerated plumages to help Endeavor take to skies even further. In the midst of facing the body-modified Tomura, Endeavor realized that the villain was able to leap vast distances through the air, was not due to Quirk usage, but due to pure strength yielding air pressure, similar to All Might. 
            </p>
          <h5><li>Indomitable Will</li></h5>
            <p>
              One of Endeavor's most prominent traits is his ability to never give up, befitting of his hero name. This was shown in two prominent instances: where he continues to bridge the gap between him and All Might regardless of the differences in their abilities, and continues to push past his limits and injuries in his battle against Hood. In the latter instance, Endeavor, seeing his old self reflected in Hood, resolved to no longer be the misguided and virulent person he has been his whole life, and used that resolution to go beyond his bodily limitations and finally defeat the High-End Nomu for good, all while finally embracing U.A. High School's "Plus Ultra" credo that he previously deplored.

        <h3>Quirk: Hellflame</h3>
        <ul class="cont" style="list-style-type:square;">
          <p>
            <li>
              Enji's Quirk allows him to produce and manipulate large amounts of extremely intense fire at will.
              <br>   
              <br>
              He appears to be immune to other flames, and can easily control the shape and temperature of the blaze as well. Enji's level of control enables him to utilize his flames in unorthodox ways, such as concentrating flames and heat to his feet to achieve limited flight. He has been shown shaping his flames into long-range and melee weapons, such as when he struck a Nomu with a spear made of fire.    
            </li>
              <br>
              <br>
            <li>
              Using too much of his power will overheat Endeavor's body, causing a depletion of stamina, and an impairment of his physical functions.
